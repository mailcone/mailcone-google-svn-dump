TODO
====

- define and check for mails (in which interval or do we expect mails, ...)
- rule should have a possibility to add test Mail (testing if rule works like it have to)

- if name (for example rule) also id should change
- if id exists error raised

- master.pt is at the moment (for extensions) a syslink on filesystem!

- make diffrent core packages (mfa_core_ruleset, mfa_core_rule, ...)

- Test rule with mail

- Popup will have some problems if rules of diffrent rule sets have the same id

- Add user pw and pw confirm can be not the same
- Not validate if user already exist
- Edit user doesn't work yet

- editicons_macro.pt - src static variable does not work - for the moment solved with hard coded src strings

- send mail to default mail address, which list all not matched mails
- each rule contains last modification date and user, as well as last match date
    - last modification user and date is implemented
    - set last_modi_user for rule content must be solved better
    - last match is not implemented yet
- right of rule information input field for test mail (test mail has a problem is not imported in DATABASE, so there is a cause of defect which could be forgotten)
- icons add filter and action
- interval is mail expected (yes/no) an if yes period of expected mails (could be defined in month, days hours)
- period is calculate (last action + 24 hours = 1 day)

- js script for complex match filter does not work at the moment (looks like condition string is the problem) (example ".+mlempen@raptus.com.+")

- user configlet is a mess, cleanup

- js, ajax for saving app configuraiton in appConfiglet
- Validator's for Forms and also for js-Scripts

- documentation of js-scripts and python code

- style forms

- define vars for python code filter

- cleanup choice fields, perhaps make base class

- add / edit Ruleset, js should display current ruleset

- logic for severity not implemented

- simple match filter does not work like they should

- update ICopy (Rule)

- popup js for testmail
- icon for testmail 

- load rulesets popup, hover show description of ruleset or rule

- smtp server must be configurable
